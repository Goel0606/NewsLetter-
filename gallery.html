                <p align="center">Before the Budget 2024 date, Amit Goel, Co-Founder & Chief Global Strategist at Pace 360, advises caution due to the expected volatility. While averages show a slight decline before the budget, significant volatility can create opportunities but also heighten risks. In this pre-budget period, it's advisable to buy stocks in sectors that could benefit from the budget, anticipating a post-budget rise. Increased volatility can present opportunities for short-term options traders, who are advised to use strategies like straddles or strangles to capitalize on price swings in either direction.

        <p align="center">New Delhi: As the US reeled from images of a bloodied Donald Trump waving his fist after the gunman opened fire at a campaign rally in Pennsylvania yesterday, Joe Biden - in his address to the nation - called for unity and said that American politics "must never be a literal battlefield".
            While he appeared to start off well, the US President soon began to stumble over his words.
            
            During his speech, Joe Biden inadvertently referred to resolving differences at the "battle box" instead of the "ballot box."

    <h3 align="center">Supreme Court Dismisses Karnataka Dy CM DK Shivakumar's Plea To Quash CBI's Disproportionate Assets Case</h3>
    <p align="center">

        The Supreme Court today (July 15) dismissed Karnataka Deputy Chief Minister DK Shivakumar's petition challenging a High Court order, whereby his plea to quash the Central Bureau of Investigation's disproportionate assets (DA) case against him under the Prevention of Corruption Act (PCA) was rejected.

A bench of Justices Bela M Trivedi and Satish Chandra Sharma heard the matter.

Senior Advocate Mukul Rohatgi, appearing for Shivakumar, submitted that the investigation has commenced without obtaining the sanction under Section 17A of the Prevention of Corruption Act. He further contended that the issue whether Section 17A applies to offences allegedly committed before the 2018 amendment (which inserted Section 17A) is referred to a larger bench [Ref. Chandrababu Naidu case]. However, Justice Trivedi replied that the proceedings cannot be quashed based on a split verdict. Rohatgi stated that he was merely requesting for issuance of notice on the petition.
